# beautifulsoup_scraping
By Alex Calderwood

Growing database of my scraping projects using BeautifulSoup4. So far, contains a Python script to download every Sparknotes summary, which I used to train word embeddings with gensim for a class project.

Feel free to submit pull requests or give me a code review! Any feedback appreciated, as I'm fairly new to scraping.


## Sparknotes Summaries

Usage:
    First make sure a folder exists called corpus_data:
        mkdir corpus_data/
    Then:
    python get_sparknotes_summaries.py
