# Scraping Examples

Growing database of my scraping projects with Python.

## Sparknotes Summaries

A Python script to download every Sparknotes summary, which I used to train word embeddings with gensim for a class project.

First make sure a folder exists called corpus_data:

    cd sparknotes/
    mkdir corpus_data/
    
Then:

    python get_sparknotes_summaries.py

## Pacer Scraping
A utility to scrape Pacer and output to a .csv.
